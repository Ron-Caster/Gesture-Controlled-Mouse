# Gesture Controlled Mouse

Task at Hand:

- Refactor code to build an entire app with perfection.
- The try failed, but there's no proof to that this project can be pushed much further to realtime for convenience of movement tracking. But some changes can be done taking inspirations from current adjustments that are done!
- Maybe consider training models to detect click
- How hard this can be when even cars are running on road with computer vision?
- Take reference till it is made
